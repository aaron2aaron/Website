    <h1>BRZ Blog: trading to my attainable dream car</h1>
    <h2>The beginning</h2>
    <p>
        My dad bought me a 2013 Nissan Juke which I am forever grateful for, 
        but it's not exactly my taste and its age is starting to show. I've
        seen people trade from pennies to houses and from hundreds to hondas.
        I want to give this whole trading thing a shot and see if I can attain
        a car worth nearly 3x my value. Thanks to my dad, I have a good start.
