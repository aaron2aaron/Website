            <p> 
                My dad bought me a 2013 Nissan Juke which I am forever grateful for, 
                but it's not exactly my taste and its age is starting to show. I've
                seen people trade from pennies to houses and from hundreds to hondas.
                I want to give this whole trading thing a shot and see if I can attain
                a car worth nearly 3x my car's value. Thanks to my dad, I have a good start.

                I made the first move towards selling/trading the Juke. It took a while 
                but I bought a part that had flown off after a big job replacing the alternator. The fender
                flare was about $90 with free shipping which I got off of ebay. I am also
                going to clean out the car so I can take pictures soon.
